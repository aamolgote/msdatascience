## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
sd<-1000
mean<-9000
se <- sd / sqrt(15)

norm <- seq(mean - (4 * sd), mean + (4 * sd), length=30)
random<- seq(mean - (4 * se), mean + (4 * se), length=30)
population <- dnorm(norm, mean, sd)
sampling <- dnorm(random, mean, se)

plot(norm, population, type="l",col="red",
  xlab="Lifespan of light bulbs", ylab = "",
  main="Two distributions Population and Sampling", ylim=c(0,0.0018))
lines(random, sampling, col="blue")
legend(1, 95, legend=c("Line 1", "Line 2"),
       col=c("red", "blue"), lty=1:2, cex=0.8)


```
