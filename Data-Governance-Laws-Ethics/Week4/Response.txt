Apart from impeachment investigation, there is a lot of controversy on the Mueller report as well, where a redacted version of the report has been made public, the entire classified report is available to the Senate Intelligence Committee. In a general sense, the argument made by the justice department was, it contained information which confidential and harm national security. This report was a culmination of data from 3 different agencies which included CIA, NSA, and FBI, so hypothetically it could include information of witnesses who are willing to talk only from closed doors, it could contain information about human assets deployed by CIA overseas or information from foreign nations. So making the whole report public would be problematic as all these sources would be in the public eye, alien nations would not share data due to breach of trust, individuals who have helped behind closed doors would think twice. On the flip side that the administration under the cover of top-secret information might be undermining the deeds which should not be done.
As far as private sector organizations are concerned I agree that they have the right to keep certain data as confidential and accessibility of this data creates hindrances for taking decisions in a dynamic competitive market, but here is another side to this as well, some organizations under the name of confidentiality cook up numbers on the books and indicate false profit numbers, this has led to various scams across the world e.g. WorldCom 2002, Lehman Brothers 2008.
