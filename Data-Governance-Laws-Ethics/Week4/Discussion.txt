Typically a coporate organization classifies the data as Company confidential, Private, Sensitive and public. Government agencies classify as public, confidential, secret and top secret. Data classification is subject to the domain it gets aligned to, but in nutshell they both abide by the same data classifications constructs. Data that is usually classified is top secret or highly confidential is for a specific pupose so that it does not fall in some one's hand with criminal intent, who can then take undue advantage of the data that is available. For e.g. in the coporate world every publicly listed company need to file an earnign report, this has to remain confidential till the official release date, if released earlier it could create a havoc to company stock price. Lot of companie keep their product development plan and new features as highly confidential, this is primarily to safeguard their competitive adavnatage, any leak can cause financial long term loss.  Apple for example is well known for its secretive product development, and so far it has paid divdend to make it most valuable comapny in the world. Apart from orgnizations need to keep lot of data related to its employees as Private, this include background reports, medical reports and keeping this information restrictive is beneficial to to the empoyer as well as employees. 

So till now we have discussed how keeping infomration classified as secret or top secret beenfits orgnizations. But there are other isde effect of this this phenomenon, typically the data classification for goverment agency or n orgnization is done by certain set of core people, now these could classify the information as top secret or secret for their own interest and dta visiability is limited they can carry out the acts which are for their onw personal interest. A classic example is of all political donations made to a particular candidate by Super pacs or non profits are kept as confidential, evene though there are laws to disclose the contributions, but they are loop holes in these laws which does not ncessariliy dicalose each and every contribution. Now these contributions could be to influnce certain laws to be modified in suach a way that it benefits contributing person or organization. THis is evident from the stances that sentor takes on common issues related to climate chnage, gun control etc. Instead if the laws are mode more stricter to not keep caping contribution as secretive and make it public, then voters can make bettee choice.
